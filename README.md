# NoteTaker

## Description

This is a simple note taker app that will allow the user to write, save, and delete notes.

## Usage and Requirements

This program runs from Node and will require the associated dependencies as well as the uuidv4 dependency to work properly. The server is started by entering 'node server.js' in the VS Code terminal, which also launches the website on localhost: 3001. Once open you will click enter on the initial page to enter the app proper. From this screen you can type a note title and note body and save by clicking the floppy disk icon on the upper right hand corner. You can add as many notes as you would like and also delete by clicking the red trash can associated with each entered note. A link to a video walkthrough is located in the links section.
